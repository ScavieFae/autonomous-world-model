# Problem: `anchor build` fails with blake3 edition2024 error

## Environment
- macOS (Darwin, aarch64)
- Rust 1.93.1 (system)
- Solana CLI 3.0.15 (Agave)
- Anchor CLI 0.32.1 (via AVM)
- `anchor-lang = "0.32.1"` in Cargo.toml

## What happens
`anchor build` fails with:
```
error: failed to download `blake3 v1.8.3`
  feature `edition2024` is required
  ...not stabilized in this version of Cargo (1.84.0)
```

## The paradox
- **System cargo** (1.93.1) resolves the dependency tree fine — `cargo tree -i blake3` says "did not match any packages". blake3 is NOT in Cargo.lock.
- **`anchor build`** still tries to download blake3 1.8.3 using the **SBF toolchain's bundled cargo** (v1.84.0), which can't parse edition 2024.
- The SBF toolchain's cargo appears to be resolving a *different* dependency tree than system cargo, or ignoring Cargo.lock entirely.

## Project location
`/Users/queenmab/claude-projects/autonomous-world-model/solana/`

## Key files
- `Cargo.toml` (workspace): members = `["programs/cu-benchmark"]`, resolver = "2"
- `programs/cu-benchmark/Cargo.toml`: `anchor-lang = "0.32.1"`, has `idl-build` feature
- `Cargo.lock`: generated by system cargo, contains anchor-lang 0.32.1, does NOT contain blake3

## What we need
Get `anchor build` to succeed for the `cu-benchmark` program so we can deploy to a local validator and measure CU costs of INT8 matmul operations.

## Possible angles
1. The SBF platform-tools bundled with Solana 3.0.15 ships cargo 1.84.0 — is there a way to update just the platform-tools?
2. `anchor build` may run a separate cargo invocation (for IDL gen?) that doesn't respect the existing Cargo.lock
3. Maybe `cargo build-sbf` directly (bypassing anchor) would work differently
4. Could downgrade to Solana CLI 2.1.x which might have newer platform-tools cargo
5. Might need `solana-install update` or manual platform-tools override
